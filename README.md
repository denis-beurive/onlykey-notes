# Configuring GitHub account

Follow the instructions here: [Configuring two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-fido-u2f)

First you need to configure two-factor authentication using a TOTP. To do that, install [Twilio Authy 2-Factor Authentication application](https://authy.com/download/) on your smartphone or your desktop computer.

Then configure a security key, on the [GitHub Settings page](https://github.com/settings/two_factor_authentication/configure).

**1.** Connect the OnlyKey on the computer and unlock it.

**2.** On the section "Security keys", enter a name for the key and click on the "Add" button.

**3.** The led on the OnlyKey blinks in blue.

**4.** When asked to perform an action on the device, just touch one button on the OnlyKey.

That's it.
